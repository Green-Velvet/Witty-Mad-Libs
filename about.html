      <p>
        Hailing from Southern California, Humberto enjoys hiking,
        paddleboarding and swimming in his free time with his friends. He has a trusty
        furry canine companion named Noble. He takes Noble with him on all his hikes. He is the
        eldest of five brothers, so all his life, he's been kept busy. He's traveled the world and
        captured many memories on his trusty camera. Next on his todo list? Learn to be the best
        software engineer he can be!
