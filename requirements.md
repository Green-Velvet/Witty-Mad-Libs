## MVP

- Our Minimum Viable Product is a working Madlib generator that takes the user's input and makes a random generated limerick.

- Our stretch goal would be to add a small-scale battleship-like game that prompts the user for Madlib input when a ship is hit.

- The stretch goal would replace the form to collect user input for the Madlib.

## Data Flow
